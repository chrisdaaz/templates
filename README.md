#Building a new Northwestern website?

Developers can use branded templates to build school and office websites.

- *Department Templates* - a full site with multiple page options
- *Header/Footer Template* - header/footer with navigation to incorporate into your existing site

The CSS was written using SASS. The source files can be found in /sass/ and the master file is /sass/styles.scss. The included /css/styles.css is for demo purposes only and not for production. Use a SASS compiler to create a proper CSS production file.

Please visit our [Department Templates Pattern Library](http://www.northwestern.edu/templates/) (login required) for additional documentation on header lockups, navigation dropdowns, page types, etc.

**Note:** We are not accepting pull requests. If you have a submission for us to consider or have an issue with these files, please use the Contact Us link on our Department Templates site and we will be in touch.
