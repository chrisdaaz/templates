#Building a new Northwestern website?

Developers can use branded templates to build school and office websites.

- *Department Templates* - a full site with multiple page options
- *Header/Footer Template* - header/footer with navigation to incorporate into your existing site

The CSS for these templates was written using SASS. These files can be found in /sass/ and the master file is /sass/styles.css. The included /css/styles.css is for demo purposes only and not production. Use your favorite SASS compiler to create a CSS production file.

Please visit our [Department Templates Pattern Library](http://www.northwestern.edu/templates/) (login required) for additional documentation on header lockups, navigation dropdowns, page types, etc.

**Note:** We are currently not accepting updates via git. If you have a submission for us to consider or have an issue with these files, please use the Contact Us link on our Departmental Templates site and we will be in touch.
