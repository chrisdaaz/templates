#Building a new Northwestern website?

Developers can use branded templates as a starting point to build school and office websites.

- *Department Templates* - full site with multiple page options
- *Header/Footer Template* - header/footer to incorporate into an existing site or application

The CSS was written in SASS. The source files can be found in /scss/ and the master file is /scss/styles.scss. The included /css/styles.css is for demo purposes only and not intended for production. Use a SASS compiler to create a proper CSS production file (i.e. Scout-App, Koala, Prepros).

Visit our [Department Templates Pattern Library](http://www.northwestern.edu/templates/) (login required) for additional documentation on header lockups, navigation dropdowns, page types, etc.

**Note:** We do not accept pull requests. If you have a submission for us to consider or have an issue with these files, please use the Contact Us link on our Department Templates site and we will be in touch.
